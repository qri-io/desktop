## [0.3.2](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2) (2020-01-22)

This release brings a two new features and some fixes that address bugs that occured while navigating through the app.

## Schema Editor
You can now edit a schema straight from the app! You can change the title, type, and description of your columns by using our new Schema Editor. Validation is also included in this Schema Editor, but future refinements will be made to get it to be more functional.

## Bug logging
If you are having a problem with the app and you want to file an issue, you can now get a copy of your app's debug log by navigating to `help` -> `Export debug log`. This will give the developers more insight into what may have gone wrong.

## Routing and Fetching
There were a whole slew of bugs that arose when we switched the way we route the app. This release fixes those bugs and brings back a smooth user experience. Also, additional tests have been added so that we will catch any routing bugs quicker during future changes

# [0.3.0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0) (2019-12-12)

Welcome to Qri Desktop 0.3.0! We've made a huge overhaul on our UI and UX design in this release as well as streamlined some key flows in the app.

## Redesign
We've changed the layout of our app to switch between two main views: the Collections view and the Dataset view. On the Collections page, you can view a list of all your datasets, get important key details about them, and use drag and drop functionality to create a new dataset from an existing file easily. The Dataset page is where you can view and edit a specific dataset. The 'Status' pane reflects the status of the dataset as it exists now, highlighting changes you have made since your last commit and allowing you to make edits to the structure, metadata, and readme portions of your dataset. The 'History' pane allows you to explore previous versions of your dataset, so you can see what has changed over time.

We've also adjusted the commit message view. We want to encourage you to write detailed messages that describe the work that went into creating the latest version of the dataset and what has changed. To help that, we've moved the commit message to its own page to give you the room to write down all the helpful information that's in your head.

## Import
One important flow that has been redesigned and streamlined is the import flow. It's incredibly easy to add a dataset to Qri: all you need to do is drag and drop the main file over the app and Qri Desktop will add the file to Qri and create an initial commit, giving you a starting point as you work on your dataset. We now have a progress bar that estimates the time needed to add your dataset. Once it has been imported, if you want to edit the dataset and make further changes or improvements, you can do so on the 'Status' pane. Just 'Checkout' the dataset to a folder on your computer and you can make edits in the Qri Desktop app, or in any other program. As long as those files remain in that folder, Qri can pick up those changes for you and display them in the Qri Desktop app.

## Rename
We wanted to make changing your dataset's name as easy as possible. Once you import a dataset using the drag and drop functionality, Qri will guess the dataset name based on the file name. You can easily re-name it when you are on the Dataset page by clicking on the name!

### Bug Fixes

* **bodyValue:** account for null or undefined previous body values ([f9a93e0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/f9a93e0))
* **readme:** add readme to commitDetails reducer ([38e545d](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/38e545d))
* **StatsChart:** fix rename bugs ([ccadc62](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/ccadc62))


### Features

* add dataset rename ([a505582](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/a505582))
* add dataset rename ([6f993f4](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/6f993f4))

* **transform:** initial support for transform display ([7797cad](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/7797cad))



## [0.2.1](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1) (2019-11-18)

This release cycle we focused on two features (Readmes and Stats), various bug fixes, and bringing storybook into desktop for development:

## Readmes 
Now you can create Readme markdown files with Qri Desktop! Qri Desktop will also automatically pick up a `readme.md` file that exists in the dataset folder, if you have connected the dataset to a folder. It will also pick up any changes to that file. You can also preview the rendered and formatted readme before saving your changes to the dataset.

## Stats
Qri can now automatically generate useful stats based on your dataset. If you're dataset is tabular, you can view these stats by clicking on a column header. Different column header types generate different stats, eg, numeric column types will generate averages and medians, string column types will generate a max length and min length, etc. These stats give you an overview of what is happening inside your dataset and can be used to spot check your data!

### Bug Fixes

* **BodyTable:** if we've fetchedAll, do not fetch another page ([2f5a954](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/2f5a954))
* **bodyValue:** account for null or undefined previous body values ([afef2ed](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/afef2ed))
* **ComponentList:** right-click to discard change from `ComponentList` works again ([d6dfef7](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/d6dfef7))
* **DetailsBar:** fix transition ([97beb8b](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/97beb8b))
* **readme:** fixes to get correct html from render response ([c28d49b](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/c28d49b))
* **StatsChart:** fix rename bugs ([a7b05e2](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/a7b05e2))

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2019-11-06)

Hello friends! This is our first major change to the Qri Desktop since release!

This release comes packaged with the latest version of Qri (check out more about that in the [Qri v0.9.1 release docs](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/releases/tag/v0.9.1)).

We've fixed some major bugs that our lovely betas have requested ([learn how to become an official beta here](https://qri.io/beta/)) and we've made improvements based on how we've seen the app get used.

## Adding Structure to Schema
We've moved the schema component into structure. This change lets you configure how formats like CSV are interpreted from within Qri Desktop!

If you were having trouble with header rows showing up in Body before, you'll see new options in the structure component that let you fix the issue. We've also renamed the file where this is stored from schema.json to structure.json, and moved schema inside the structure.json file.

## 🏎 Faster Data Views!
We've updated our csv and json viewers to be snappier and better formatted! This should make working with large datasets much easier.


You can now export your dataset (and get the underlying data and files) at any version by right-clicking the version, in the `History` and clicking `Export Version`

The app is now notarized for macOS 10.15.1

Thanks!

<a name="v0.1.0-rc1"></a>
# v0.1.0-rc1 (2019-09-4)

Welcome to the Qri Desktop release candidate! Qri Desktop is an app for creating and managing datasets and versions (meant to replace the Qri Frontend app). It gives a UI to our qri commandline tool. This is a release candidate, so all features have not been perfected yet. Qri Desktop will make it easy for you to create and version datasets, look back through the history of your datasets to see what has changed, and to double check your changes before you commit them! You can also publish your datasets and add colleagues datasets' that have already been published. 

Qri is an amalgamation of three hefty areas: a version control system, a network to other data users, and a database for your local data. In order to make working with Qri and it's local database easier, we have implimented a way to integrate your normal filesystem to our database. You can have your working directories where you keep your current workspace and data, but still be able to commit/save to your qri database at important times during your workflow. Using Qri, you can load your data from those specific points if you have made a mistake, or you just want to view the data at a different point in time. **The Qri Desktop app gives you the ability to visualize all those different versions and your different datasets from one application.**

Even though this is a release candidate, Qri Desktop is extremely functional and can be used right away to begin versioning and publishing your data! The main feature we are missing (which is why we are considering this a candidate and not an official release as of yet) is the ability to delete dataset versions from inside the Qri Desktop app. This functionality exists in the command line client, which comes bundled with Qri Desktop. [Check out the Qri CLI reference here if you run into this problem.](https://qri.io/docs/reference/cli_commands/#qri_remove)

We are also currently cleaning up our `add` functionality. If you are trying to add from the network, you will most likely encounter bugs. This will be cleaned up by the next release.

On our immediate roadmap:
- the ability to delete versions of a dataset
- basic metadata editing within the app
- adjustments to onboarding, specifically how a user goes from zero to one dataset
- tuning the file system integration for easier/more expected use
