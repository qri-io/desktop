## [0.4.4](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.4.3...v0.4.4) (2020-08-10)

Quick release to upgrade to the latest qri backend! Fixed a bug some users were experiencing when downloading Qri Desktop for the first time.

Be sure to check out the latest [qri backend release](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/releases/tag/v0.9.11) to see the other fixes we inherit.

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3) (2020-07-28)

Our latest release for desktop has improved stability, added support for backend migrations, upgraded api calls to match the latest qri backend release, and reduced the codebase without losing functionality!

### refactor to match the new 0.9.10 qri api
Changes made to match the latest qri api:
- use `/get?format=zip` instead of  `/export`
- use `/pull` instead of `/add`
- use `/push` instead of `/publish`
- use `/remove?remote=registry` to unpublish a dataset
- rely on log data to determine if the dataset is published, not on the dataset itself

### dev/codebase improvements:
We've got storybook back up and running! This involved refactoring certain components to ensure that they can still function as expected inside and outside of the electron framework (so they can be potentially be used in other webapps).

We've solidified terminology in the codebase: anything prefixed with `Working` indicates that has to do with editing a dataset. We've also removed the `History` prefix from components dealing with historical dataset versions.

We've gone through an entire component/container overhaul:
  * We've removed every container file. 
  * All connecting of components to react redux and the router happens in the same file that the component is defined. 
  * The "component" version of this file is exported and has the suffix "Component". 
  * The "containerized" version of this component is the default export.
  * The custom connect functions are `connectComponentToProps` and `connectComponentToPropsWithRouter`. 
  * They take the same parameters and have the same expectations as the redux `connect` function.

### readme markdown
Make sure you take a look at the improved styling in our readme markdown editor!

### New backend launch process

We've got a revamped backend launch process that coordinates version verifications, migrations, and communication to the user.

We check and inform the user if the backend version they are using in incompatible. We check and inform the user if the backend needs an update. We initiate the update and inform the user if there were any migration errors. And if everything goes well, we launch the backend!

New Components:
- IncompatibleBackend
- MigratingBackend
- MigrationFailed

Be sure to check out the latest [qri backend release](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/releases/tag/v0.9.7) to see the lovely fixes we inherit.

## Export
In a combined effort from the backend and desktop, we've fixed the export bug! Right-clicking the version you want to export, and clicking 'export this version', opens the save dialog, prefilled with a default zipname.

## API changes
This desktop update adjusts our requests to meet the expectations of the latest qri backend's API

## Reloading
Because of those wonderful backend api changes, we were able to fix a long-standing bug where re-loading on the `workbench` page broke the app. Now you can reload to your heart's content

## Websockets
Combining websockets and the backend status request changes, we are able to more intelligently re-fetch fsi linked datasets as you make changes to them using a text editor and the qri desktop app.

## Editing
Cleaned up a whole lotta bugs surrounding ui flickering in meta and structure editing. Also, all meta and structure fields are now tested in our visual end to end tests.

# [0.4.0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.3.5...v0.4.0) (2020-03-05)

Release notes 0.4.0

Welcome to the Qri Desktop App version 0.4.0!

This version is one of our biggest to date. We've got a whole slew of new features for you to explore & a number of bugs have been squashed. With this release you can now browse, search, and clone datasets, all within the app. We’ve brought dataset editing in-app, and we’re premiering our first visual diffing tool with the compare section.


## Network Explorer

The first big feature we’re showing off is our new Network page. Browse the Qri network in app! Preview featured and recently published datasets without having to download the full dataset. Find a dataset you want to view in its entirety? **Clone** the dataset! That will download it from the network to your computer.

This also means that when you publish, other users will be able to see your work directly in-app. More people will see your work!

## Dataset Search

And what browsing experience would be complete without **search**? We put a navigation bar at the top of the app so you can search the Qri network or your own local Qri repo for datasets, no matter where you are in the app.

There is also a back and forward button in the nav bar so you can walk back through your browsing history.

## In-App Editing

You can now edit your dataset in app without having to checkout your files to the file system! This streamlines and simplifies iteration for those who don't need the feature of linking your dataset to a folder on your computer.

You can edit the Readme, Meta, and Structure component in the Status tab of the Workbench. To make changes to the Body, edit the file using an appropriate app (text editors, Numbers, Excel, etc.), save (as .csv), and **drag and drop** the new version of the body file onto the Body component. When you make your commit, your new version will contain that updated body!

## Diff CSV’s with the Compare View

The next phase of features for Qri involve heavy use of structured data diffing, and we’re starting with an experiment. Use the compare view to generate a diff of any two csv files. This feature is very much a work-in-progress. If you have any feedback while you use the compare view, please let us know by filing an issue!

In the future we plan to expand to other file formats, dataset comparison, and up the size limit. We plan to make diff display one of the central things Qri does, and once we’re sure we have a stable, accurate compare view, we’ll start adding it more and more places throughout the app.

# [0.3.0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0) (2019-12-12)

Welcome to Qri Desktop 0.3.0! We've made a huge overhaul on our UI and UX design in this release as well as streamlined some key flows in the app.

## Redesign
We've changed the layout of our app to switch between two main views: the Collections view and the Dataset view. On the Collections page, you can view a list of all your datasets, get important key details about them, and use drag and drop functionality to create a new dataset from an existing file easily. The Dataset page is where you can view and edit a specific dataset. The 'Status' pane reflects the status of the dataset as it exists now, highlighting changes you have made since your last commit and allowing you to make edits to the structure, metadata, and readme portions of your dataset. The 'History' pane allows you to explore previous versions of your dataset, so you can see what has changed over time.

We've also adjusted the commit message view. We want to encourage you to write detailed messages that describe the work that went into creating the latest version of the dataset and what has changed. To help that, we've moved the commit message to its own page to give you the room to write down all the helpful information that's in your head.

## Import
One important flow that has been redesigned and streamlined is the import flow. It's incredibly easy to add a dataset to Qri: all you need to do is drag and drop the main file over the app and Qri Desktop will add the file to Qri and create an initial commit, giving you a starting point as you work on your dataset. We now have a progress bar that estimates the time needed to add your dataset. Once it has been imported, if you want to edit the dataset and make further changes or improvements, you can do so on the 'Status' pane. Just 'Checkout' the dataset to a folder on your computer and you can make edits in the Qri Desktop app, or in any other program. As long as those files remain in that folder, Qri can pick up those changes for you and display them in the Qri Desktop app.

## Rename
We wanted to make changing your dataset's name as easy as possible. Once you import a dataset using the drag and drop functionality, Qri will guess the dataset name based on the file name. You can easily re-name it when you are on the Dataset page by clicking on the name!

### Bug Fixes

* **bodyValue:** account for null or undefined previous body values ([f9a93e0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/f9a93e0))
* **readme:** add readme to commitDetails reducer ([38e545d](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/38e545d))
* **StatsChart:** fix rename bugs ([ccadc62](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/ccadc62))


### Features

* add dataset rename ([a505582](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/a505582))
* add dataset rename ([6f993f4](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/6f993f4))

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1) (2019-11-18)

This release cycle we focused on two features (Readmes and Stats), various bug fixes, and bringing storybook into desktop for development:

## Readmes 
Now you can create Readme markdown files with Qri Desktop! Qri Desktop will also automatically pick up a `readme.md` file that exists in the dataset folder, if you have connected the dataset to a folder. It will also pick up any changes to that file. You can also preview the rendered and formatted readme before saving your changes to the dataset.

## Stats
Qri can now automatically generate useful stats based on your dataset. If you're dataset is tabular, you can view these stats by clicking on a column header. Different column header types generate different stats, eg, numeric column types will generate averages and medians, string column types will generate a max length and min length, etc. These stats give you an overview of what is happening inside your dataset and can be used to spot check your data!

### Bug Fixes

* **BodyTable:** if we've fetchedAll, do not fetch another page ([2f5a954](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/2f5a954))
* **bodyValue:** account for null or undefined previous body values ([afef2ed](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/commit/afef2ed))

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2019-11-06)

Hello friends! This is our first major change to the Qri Desktop since release!

This release comes packaged with the latest version of Qri (check out more about that in the [Qri v0.9.1 release docs](https://github.com/qri-io/qri/releases/tag/v0.9.1)).

We've fixed some major bugs that our lovely betas have requested ([learn how to become an official beta here](https://qri.io/beta/)) and we've made improvements based on how we've seen the app get used.

## Adding Structure to Schema
We've moved the schema component into structure. This change lets you configure how formats like CSV are interpreted from within Qri Desktop!

If you were having trouble with header rows showing up in Body before, you'll see new options in the structure component that let you fix the issue. We've also renamed the file where this is stored from schema.json to structure.json, and moved schema inside the structure.json file.

## 🏎 Faster Data Views!
We've updated our csv and json viewers to be snappier and better formatted! This should make working with large datasets much easier.


You can now export your dataset (and get the underlying data and files) at any version by right-clicking the version, in the `History` and clicking `Export Version`

The app is now notarized for macOS 10.15.1

Thanks!

# v0.1.0-rc1 (2019-09-4)

Welcome to the Qri Desktop release candidate! Qri Desktop is an app for creating and managing datasets and versions (meant to replace the Qri Frontend app). It gives a UI to our qri commandline tool. This is a release candidate, so all features have not been perfected yet. Qri Desktop will make it easy for you to create and version datasets, look back through the history of your datasets to see what has changed, and to double check your changes before you commit them! You can also publish your datasets and add colleagues datasets' that have already been published. 

Qri is an amalgamation of three hefty areas: a version control system, a network to other data users, and a database for your local data. In order to make working with Qri and it's local database easier, we have implimented a way to integrate your normal filesystem to our database. You can have your working directories where you keep your current workspace and data, but still be able to commit/save to your qri database at important times during your workflow. Using Qri, you can load your data from those specific points if you have made a mistake, or you just want to view the data at a different point in time. **The Qri Desktop app gives you the ability to visualize all those different versions and your different datasets from one application.**

Even though this is a release candidate, Qri Desktop is extremely functional and can be used right away to begin versioning and publishing your data! The main feature we are missing (which is why we are considering this a candidate and not an official release as of yet) is the ability to delete dataset versions from inside the Qri Desktop app. This functionality exists in the command line client, which comes bundled with Qri Desktop. [Check out the Qri CLI reference here if you run into this problem.](https://qri.io/docs/reference/cli_commands/#qri_remove)

We are also currently cleaning up our `add` functionality. If you are trying to add from the network, you will most likely encounter bugs. This will be cleaned up by the next release.

On our immediate roadmap:
- the ability to delete versions of a dataset
- basic metadata editing within the app
- adjustments to onboarding, specifically how a user goes from zero to one dataset
- tuning the file system integration for easier/more expected use
